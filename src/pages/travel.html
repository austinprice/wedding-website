                <p class="pr-12 my-4">Festivities will be held nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. This area is very special to Cat and her family (and now Austin, too!). Like many small mountain towns, there aren't many large hotels nearby but there are a lot of lovely Airbnb, VRBO and boutique hotel options.</p>
